# 📝 To-Do List Application (Data Structures Project)

This project is a terminal-based To-Do List application written in **C**, created for the **CPE112 Data Structures** course.  
It helps users manage tasks with scheduling, reminders, priority adjustment, and statistics using key data structures.

---

## 📚 Introduction

In daily life, tasks often vary in priority and urgency. Traditional to-do lists fail to address:
- Deadlines approaching
- Reordering priorities dynamically
- Tracking completed tasks
- Efficient searching and filtering
- Data backup and recovery

This project solves those problems by:
- Using a **linked list** for dynamic task management
- Applying a **stack** to track completed items with undo support
- Implementing **sorting algorithms** for task organization
- Including **date handling** and automatic status updates
- Supporting **tag-based organization** and advanced search features

---

## 📌 Overview

Managing tasks with different levels of urgency is a common challenge.  
This To-Do List application enables:
- Task creation with due dates, priorities, and tags
- Automatic status updates (Pending/Overdue)
- Undo functionality for task completion
- Advanced search and filtering capabilities
- Import/Export functionality for data persistence

It's designed to improve productivity, reduce stress, and provide an organized workflow in a **command-line interface**.

## 🧠 Data Structures Used

| Structure | Purpose | Time Complexity |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| **Linked List** | Store tasks dynamically | O(1) insertion, O(n) search |
| **Stack** | Track completed tasks (Undo/Clear) | O(1) push/pop |
| **Arrays** | Temporary storage for sorting | O(n) space |
| **Bubble Sort** | Organize tasks by date/priority | O(n²) time |

## 💻 How to Run the Code

### 🧾 Requirements
- A C compiler (`gcc`)
- All header files (`scheduler.h`, `task_management.h`, `searchstats.h`) and `main.c` in the same folder

### ⚙️ Compilation

first
```bash
gcc -o todolist main.c task_management.c searchandstat.c scheduler.c fileio.c
```
then 
```bash
./todolist
```
the file should run properly

5. Undo Last Completed Task
6. Delete Task
7. Search Tasks
8. View Statistics (All/Week/Month)
9. Clear All Completed Tasks
10. Import Tasks
11. Export Tasks
12. Daily Completed Tasks
13. Simulate Day Change
14. Time Period Summary (Week/Month)

## 🧪 Test Cases

### Test Case 1: Add Task with Valid Input

**Input:**
```bash
Option: 1
Task name: Complete Assignment
Description: Finish DSA homework
Priority: 1
Due date: 10 05 2025
```
**Expected Output:**
```bash
Task added successfully!
```

### Test Case 2: Invalid Date Input
**Input:**
```bash
Option: 1
Task name: Test Task
Due date: 32 13 2025
```
**Expected Output:**
```bash
Invalid date. Due date not set.
```

### Test Case 3: Duplicate Task Name
**Input:**
```bash
Option: 1
Task name: Complete Assignment (existing task)
```
**Expected Output:**
```bash
Error: A task with this name already exists. Please choose a different name.
```

### Test Case 4: Search Non-existent Task
**Input:**
```bash
Option: 7
Search option: 1
Keyword: NonExistentTask
```
**Expected Output:**
```bash
No matching tasks found.
```

### Test Case 5: Complete and Undo Task
**Input:**
```bash
Option: 4
Task name: Complete Assignment
Option: 5
```
**Expected Output:**
```bash
Task 'Complete Assignment' marked as completed!
Last completed task restored to the list.
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Running Test Cases
1. Import test data:
((tasks_import.txt , sample_tasks.txt))
```bash
Option: 10
Filename: tasks_import.txt
```
2. Verify error handling:
- Try adding duplicate task names
- Enter invalid dates (32/13/2025)
- Input out-of-range priorities (0, 4)

3. Test core functionality:
- Add, edit, delete tasks
- Complete and undo operations
- Search with various criteria
- View statistics

### Performance Testing
Run performance analysis (Option 17) to see:
- Operation timing for different data sizes
- Complexity verification
- Memory usage statistics

### Edge Cases Tested
- Empty task list operations
- Maximum capacity handling (1000+ tasks)
- Invalid input formats
- Boundary date values
- Special characters in task names
